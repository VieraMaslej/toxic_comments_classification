# toxic_comments_classification

## Abstract
The emergence of anti-social behaviour in online environments presents a serious issue in today's society. Automatic detection and identification of such behaviour are becoming increasingly important. Modern machine learning and natural language processing methods can provide effective tools to detect different types of anti-social behaviour from the pieces of text. In this work, we present a comparison of various deep learning models used to identify the toxic comments in the Internet discussions. Our main goal was to explore the effect of the data preparation on the model performance. As we worked with the assumption that the use of traditional pre-processing methods may lead to the loss of characteristic traits, specific for toxic content, we compared the models' performance with and without pre-processing and using different word embeddings. Experiments were performed on the popular dataset from the Kaggle Toxic Comment Classification competition, and the best performing model was compared with the similar approaches using standard metrics used in data analysis.
